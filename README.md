Writing Scripts Descended from Egyptian Hieroglyphs

This is a project involving linguistics, history, art, and academia to show how connected we are as humans.

Almost all of today's writing scripts are descended from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Some scripts are universally agreed descended from this common ancestor, while others' relationships are on shakier grounds.

Here I attempt to portray the phylogenetic relationship of Egyptian hieroglyphs and her descendant scripts and allow a visual comparison between letters, while backing this up with citations to my best ability.

Individual pages of each script include basic information on the time period and locations where these scripts were used (along with a map), writing direction, and languages that use the script. The script's abecedary, examples of epigraphy, lineage tree, and comparison with Egyptian hieroglyphs, parent script, sibling scripts, and child scripts are also included.

Finally to humanise this project, I will attempt to include portraits of people who would have used these writing scripts as well.
