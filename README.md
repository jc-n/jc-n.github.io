Writing Scripts Descended from Egyptian Hieroglyphs

This is a project involving linguistics, history, and art to show how connected we are as humans by featuring Egyptian hieroglyphs, which almost all of today's writing scripts are descended from.

Here I attempt to portray the phylogenetic relationship of Egyptian hieroglyphs and her descendant scripts and allow a visual comparison between letters, while backing this up with evidence where possible.
