Writing Scripts Descended from Egyptian Hieroglyphs

Maˈtʼuww is a project involving linguistics, history, and art to show how connected we are as humans by featuring Egyptian hieroglyphs, which almost all of today's writing scripts are descended from.

The goal of maˈtʼuww is to portray the phylogenetic relationship of Egyptian hieroglyphs and her descendant scripts, and allow a visual comparison between letters, while backing this up with evidence wherever possible.

Although maˈtʼuww is not the first project to attempt writing script comparison, it attempts to do so holistically as the nature of academia promotes specialisation that limits the broader picture of this area of interest.

We hope to provide a visually informative experience that not only just educates, but also inspires curious minds that are eager to learn more.
